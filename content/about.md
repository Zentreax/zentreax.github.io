Hey, I'm Zentreax. I'm interested in:
- Programming (Java, Python, JS, Ruby)

I'm currenty 18 years old and live in Germany. In my spare time, I enjoy working on side projects, contributing to open source, making music, and web-designing. On this blog I'm publishing writeups/walkthroughs as well as projects I'm interested in.
